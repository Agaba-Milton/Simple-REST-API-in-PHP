# Simple-REST-API-in-PHP

FOR ANY JUNIOR WHO GET DIFFICULTIES WITH UNDERSTANDING APIs, HERE IS AN OVER VIEW OF YOUR STEPPING STONE TO API DEVELOPMENT IN ANY LANGUAGE.


1.1 What is REST API? To define "REST API", we have to know what is "REST" and what is "API" first. I'll do my best to explain it in simple terms because REST has a lot of concepts inside of it that could mean a lot of things. 


REST stands for "REpresentational State Transfer". It is a concept or architecture for managing information over the internet. REST concepts are referred to as resources. A representation of a resource must be stateless. It is usually represented by JSON. This post is worth reading: How I Explained REST to My Friends.




API stands for "Application Programming Interface". It is a set of rules that allows one piece of software application to talk to another. Those "rules" can include create, read, update and delete operations.  


REST API enable your application to cooperate with one or several different applications using REST concepts.  


1.2 WHY DO WE need REST API? In many applications, 


REST API is a need because this is the lightest way to create, read, update or delete information between different applications over the internet or HTTP protocol. This information is presented to the user in an instant especially if you use JavaScript to render the data on a webpage.  



1.3 Where REST API is used? REST API can be used by any application that can connect to the internet. If data from an application can be created, read, updated or deleted using another application, it usually means a REST API is used.
